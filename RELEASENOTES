Scorpio FIWARE 8.0.0
 - This release contains as main update multi tenant support. This means scorpio supports the "ngsild-tenant" header to support data separation. On the cSource side of things we do support the short name tenant in the payload and respect it in all operations. In this release we still support the v1.2.2 core context so this is effectivly a back port of the tenant feature into 1.2.2. This has an implication on the expanded stored versions of registrations. In this release they will be stored as extra property with the default prefix.
 - As we progress to merge in 1.3.1 changes we will provide the necessary migration scripts to adapt this, however anyone dealing directly with the database or kafka (which you shouldn't) be aware.
 - Tenant Entity create handling: If you create an entity with a tenant the subsequent csource registration and temporal entity creations from scorpio will also be in the registry and temporal database for the provided tenant.
 - Federated queries/subscriptions: Similar to the create queries/subscriptions will only ever use the registry of the provided tenant.
 - Default Tenant: If no tenant header is provided scorpio will behave in its default behaviour.
 - Various bugfixes were adressed
