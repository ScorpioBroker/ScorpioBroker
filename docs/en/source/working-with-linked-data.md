This tutorial teaches FIWARE users how to architect and design a system based on **linked data** and to alter linked
data context programmatically. The tutorial extends the knowledge gained from the equivalent
[NGSI-v2 tutorial](accessing-context.md) and enables a user understand how to write code in an
[NGSI-LD](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/CIM/001_099/009/01.01.01_60/gs_CIM009v010101p.pdf) capable
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) [Express](https://expressjs.com/) application in order to retrieve and alter context
data. This removes the need to use the command-line to invoke cUrl commands.

The tutorial is mainly concerned with discussing code written in Node.js, however some of the results can be checked by
making [cUrl](https://ec.haxx.se/) commands.
[Postman documentation](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Working-with-Linked-Data) for the same commands is also
available.

NGSI-LD is an evolution of NGSI-v2, so it should not be surprising that Smart solutions based on NGSI-LD will need to
cover the same basic scenarios as outlined in the previous NGSI-v2 [tutorial](accessing-context.md) on programatic data
access.

NGSI-LD Linked data formalizes the structure of context entities to a greater degree, through restricting data
attributes to be defined as either _Property_ attributes or _Relationship_ attributes only. This means that it is
possible to traverse the context data graph with greater certainty when moving from one _Relationship_ to another. All
the context data entities within the system are defined by JSON-LD data models, which are formally defined by
referencing a context file, and this programmatic definition should guarantee that the associated linked entity exists.

Three basic data access scenarios for the supermarket are defined below:

-   Reading Data - e.g. Give me all the data for the **Building** entity `urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001`
-   Aggregation - e.g. Combine the **Products** entities sold in **Building** `urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001` and
    display the goods for sale
-   Altering context within the system - e.g. Make a sale of a product:
    -   Update the daily sales records by the price of the **Product**
    -   decrement the `numberOfItems` of the **Shelf** entity
    -   Create a new Transaction Log record showing the sale has occurred
    -   Raise an alert in the warehouse if less than 10 objects remain on sale
    -   etc.

Further advanced scenarios will be covered in later tutorials

## Linked Data Entities within a stock management system

The supermarket data created in the [previous tutorial](relationships-linked-data.md) will be loaded into the context
broker. The existing relationships between the entities are defined as shown below:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Working-with-Linked-Data/img/entities-ld.png)

The **Building**, **Product**, **Shelf** and **StockOrder** entities will be used to display data on the frontend of our
demo application.

## The teaching goal of this tutorial

The aim of this tutorial is to improve developer understanding of programmatic access of context data through defining
and discussing a series of generic code examples covering common data access scenarios. For this purpose a simple
Node.js Express application will be created.

The intention here is not to teach users how to write an application in Express - indeed any language could have been
chosen. It is merely to show how **any** sample programming language could be used alter the context to achieve the
business logic goals.

Obviously, your choice of programming language will depend upon your own business needs - when reading the code below
please keep this in mind and substitute Node.js with your own programming language as appropriate.

# Stock Management Frontend

All the code Node.js Express for the demo can be found within the `ngsi-ld` folder within the GitHub repository.
[Stock Management example](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tree/master/context-provider). The
application runs on the following URLs:

-   `http://localhost:3000/app/store/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001`
-   `http://localhost:3000/app/store/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store002`
-   `http://localhost:3000/app/store/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store003`
-   `http://localhost:3000/app/store/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store004`

> **Tip** Additionally, you can also watch the status of recent requests yourself by following the container logs or
> viewing information on `localhost:3000/app/monitor` on a web browser.

# Architecture

The demo Supermarket application will send and receive NGSI-LD calls to a compliant context broker. Since the NGSI-LD
interface is available on the
[Scorpio Broker](https://scorpio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), the demo application will make use of this
FIWARE component.

Currently, the Scorpio Broker relies PostgreSQL to keep
persistence of the context data it holds. To request context data from external sources, a simple Context Provider NGSI
proxy has also been added. To visualize and interact with the Context we will add a simple Express application

Therefore, the architecture will consist of three elements:

-   The [Scorpio Broker](https://scorpio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will receive requests using
    [NGSI-LD](https://forge.etsi.org/swagger/ui/?url=https://forge.etsi.org/gitlab/NGSI-LD/NGSI-LD/raw/master/spec/updated/full_api.json)
-   The underlying PostgreSQL database :
    -   Used by the Scorpio Broker to hold context data information such as data entities, subscriptions and
        registrations
-   The **Stock Management Frontend** which will:
    -   Display store information
    -   Show which products can be bought at each store
    -   Allow users to "buy" products and reduce the stock count.

Since all interactions between the elements are initiated by HTTP requests, the entities can be containerized and run
from exposed ports.

# Traversing Linked Data Programmatically

Goto `http://localhost:3000/app/store/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001` to display and interact with the working
Supermarket data application.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Working-with-Linked-Data/img/store.png)

## Reading Linked Data

The code under discussion can be found within the `ngsi-ld/store` controller in the
[Git Repository](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Step-by-Step/blob/master/context-provider/controllers/ngsi-ld/store.js)

### Initializing the library

As usual, the code for HTTP access can be split out from the business logic of the Supermarket application itself. The
lower level calls have been placed into a library file, which simplifies the codebase. This needs to be included in the
header of the file as shown. Some constants are also required - for the Supermarket data, the `LinkHeader` is used to
define location of the data models JSON-LD context as
`https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld`.

```javascript
const ngsiLD = require("../../lib/ngsi-ld");

const LinkHeader =
    '<https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json">';
```

### Retrieve a known Store

This example reads the context data of a given **Store** entity to display the results on screen. Reading entity data
can be done using the `ngsiLD.readEntity()` method - this will fill out the URL for the GET request and make the
necessary HTTP call in an asynchronous fashion:

```javascript
async function displayStore(req, res) {
    const store = await ngsiLD.readEntity(
        req.params.storeId,
        { options: "keyValues" },
        ngsiLD.setHeaders(req.session.access_token, LinkHeader)
    );

    return res.render("store", { title: store.name, store });
}
```

The function above also sends some standard HTTP Headers as part of the request - these are defined in the
`setHeaders()` function.

Within an NGSI-LD-based system, the usual default HTTP headers would include a `Link` header to send the JSON-LD context
and a `Content-Type` header to identify the request as `application/ld+json` (note that every NGSI-LD request is valid
JSON_LD since NGSI-LD is a subset of JSON-LD). Other additional headers such as `X-Auth-Token` can be added to enable
OAuth2 security.

```javascript
function setHeaders(accessToken, link, contentType) {
    const headers = {};
    if (accessToken) {
        headers["X-Auth-Token"] = accessToken;
    }
    if (link) {
        headers.Link = link;
    }
    if (contentType) {
        headers["Content-Type"] = contentType || "application/ld+json";
    }
    return headers;
}
```

Within the `lib/ngsi-ld.js` library file, the `BASE_PATH` defines the location of the Scorpio Broker, reading a
data entity is simply a wrapper around an asynchronous HTTP GET request passing the appropriate headers

```javascript
const BASE_PATH = process.env.CONTEXT_BROKER || "http://localhost:9090/ngsi-ld/v1";

function readEntity(entityId, opts, headers = {}) {
    return request({
        qs: opts,
        url: BASE_PATH + "/entities/" + entityId,
        method: "GET",
        headers,
        json: true
    });
}
```

The equivalent cUrl statement can be seen below:

```bash
curl -G -X GET 'http://localhost:9090/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001/' \
-H 'Link: <https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/ld+json' \
-d 'type=Building' \
-d 'options=keyValues'
```

## Aggregating and Traversing Linked Data

To display information at the till, it is necessary to discover information about the products found within a Store.
From the Data Entity diagram we can ascertain that:

-   **Building** entities hold related **Shelf** information within the `furniture` _Relationship_
-   **Shelf** entities hold related **Product** information within the `stocks` _Relationship_
-   Products hold `name` and `price` as _Property_ attributes of the **Product** entity itself.

Therefore the code for the `displayTillInfo()` method will consist of the following steps.

1.  Make a request to the Context Broker to _find shelves within a known store_
2.  Reduce the result to a `id` parameter and make a second request to the Context Broker to _retrieve stocked products
    from shelves_
3.  Reduce the result to a `id` parameter and make a third request to the Context Broker to _retrieve product details
    for selected shelves_

To users familiar with database joins, it may seem strange being forced to making a series of requests like this,
however it is necessary due to scalability issues/concerns in a large distributed setup. Direct join requests are not
possible with NGSI-LD.

### Find Shelves within a known Store

To access the `furniture` attribute of a known **Building** entity, a `keyValues` request is made using the `attrs`
parameter.

```javascript
const building = await ngsiLD.readEntity(
    req.params.storeId,
    {
        type: "Building",
        options: "keyValues",
        attrs: "furniture"
    },
    ngsiLD.setHeaders(req.session.access_token, LinkHeader)
);
```

The equivalent cUrl statement can be seen below:

```bash
curl -G -X GET 'http://localhost:9090/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001/' \
-H 'Link: <https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/ld+json' \
-d 'type=Building' \
-d 'options=keyValues' \
-d 'attrs=furniture' \
```

The response is a JSON Object which includes a `furniture` attribute which can be manipulated further.

### Retrieve Stocked Products from shelves

To retrieve a series of **Shelf** entities, the `ngsiLD.listEntities()` function is called and filtered using the `id`
parameter. The `id` is just a comma separated list taken from the request above.

```javascript
let productsList = await ngsiLD.listEntities(
    {
        type: "Shelf",
        options: "keyValues",
        attrs: "stocks,numberOfItems",
        id: building.furniture.join(",")
    },
    ngsiLD.setHeaders(req.session.access_token, LinkHeader)
);
```

`listEntities()` is another function within the `lib/ngsi-ld.js` library file

```javascript
function listEntities(opts, headers = {}) {
    return request({
        qs: opts,
        url: BASE_PATH + "/entities",
        method: "GET",
        headers,
        json: true
    });
}
```

The equivalent cUrl statement can be seen below:

```bash
curl -G -X GET 'http://localhost:9090/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/' \
-H 'Link: <https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/ld+json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-d 'type=Shelf' \
-d 'options=keyValues' \
-d 'attrs=stocks,numberOfItems' \
-d 'id=urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit001,urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit002,urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit003'
```

The response is a JSON Array of **Shelf** entities which includes as `stocks` attribute which can be manipulated
further. The code below extracts the IDs for later use.

```javascript
const stockedProducts = [];

productsList = _.groupBy(productsList, e => {
    return e.stocks;
});
_.forEach(productsList, (value, key) => {
    stockedProducts.push(key);
});
```

### Retrieve Product Details for selected shelves

To retrieve a series of **Product** entities, the `ngsiLD.listEntities()` function is once again called and filtered
using the `id` parameter. The `id` is just a comma separated list taken from the request above.

```javascript
let productsInStore = await ngsiLD.listEntities(
    {
        type: "Product",
        options: "keyValues",
        attrs: "name,price",
        id: stockedProducts.join(",")
    },
    headers
);
```

The equivalent cUrl statement can be seen below:

```bash
curl -G -X GET 'http://localhost:9090/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/' \
-H 'Link: <https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/ld+json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-d 'type=Product' \
-d 'options=keyValues' \
-d 'attrs=name,price' \
-d 'id=urn:ngsi-ld:Product:001,urn:ngsi-ld:Product:003,urn:ngsi-ld:Product:004'
```

The response is a JSON Array of **Product** entities which are then displayed on screen.

## Updating Linked Data

### Find a shelf stocking a product

To retrieve a series of **Shelf** entities, the `ngsiLD.listEntities()` function is called. It is important to retrieve
the current context before amending it, so the `q` parameter is used to only retrieve a shelf from the correct store
containing the correct product. This request is only possible because the **Shelf** data model has been designed to hold
_relationships_ with both **Building** and **Product**.

```javascript
const shelf = await ngsiLD.listEntities(
    {
        type: "Shelf",
        options: "keyValues",
        attrs: "stocks,numberOfItems",
        q: 'numberOfItems>0;locatedIn=="' + req.body.storeId + '";stocks=="' + req.body.productId + '"',
        limit: 1
    },
    headers
);
```

The equivalent cUrl statement can be seen below:

```bash
curl -G -X GET 'http://localhost:9090/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/' \
-H 'Link: <https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/ld+json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-d 'type=Shelf' \
-d 'options=keyValues' \
-d 'q=numberOfItems%3E0;locatedIn==%22urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001%22;stocks==%22urn:ngsi-ld:Product:001%22'
```

### Update the state of a shelf

To update an entity a PATCH request is made using the `id` of the **Shelf** returned in the previous request

```javascript
const count = shelf[0].numberOfItems - 1;
await ngsiLD.updateAttribute(
    shelf[0].id,
    { numberOfItems: { type: "Property", value: count } },
    ngsiLD.setHeaders(req.session.access_token, LinkHeader)
);
```

The asynchronous PATCH request is found in the `updateAttribute()` function within the `lib/ngsi-ld.js` library file

```javascript
function updateAttribute(entityId, body, headers = {}) {
    return request({
        url: BASE_PATH + "/entities/" + entityId + "/attrs",
        method: "PATCH",
        body,
        headers,
        json: true
    });
}
```

The equivalent cUrl statement can be seen below:

```bash
curl -X PATCH 'http://localhost:9090/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit001/attrs' \
-H 'Link: <https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{ "numberOfItems": { "type": "Property", "value": 10 } }'
```

## Interoperability using Linked Data

The introduction of Linked Data concepts to NGSI has so far marginally increased the complexity of all the context
broker requests and we have not yet demonstrated additional benefit. The idea behind linked data is to improve data
interoperability and remove data silos.

As a demonstration of this, imagine we which to incorporate context data entities from another context provider who is
using a different schema. Rather than using `name`, `category`, `location` etc, our Japanese context provider is using
data attributes based on Kanji characters.

The core NGSI-LD `@context` defines that `name` = `https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/name`, similarly we can define `名前` =
`https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/name` and introduce alternate mappings for attribute names and enumerated values.

Provided that two systems can agree upon a **common** system of unique URIs for data interchange, they are free to
locally re-interpret those values within their own domain.

### Creating an Entity using an Alternate Schema

An alternative Japanese JSON-LD `@context` file has been created and published to an external server. The file can be
found here: `https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/japanese-context.jsonld`. Alternate data mappings can be
found for all attribute names used within the tutorials.

> **Note**: For comparision the standard tutorial JSON-LD `@context` file can be found here:
> `https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld`

#### 1 Request:

When creating a data entity, short names for all of the URIs mapped in the Japanese JSON-LD `@context` can be used
freely in the payload of the request.

As can be seen in the example below, attribute names and enumerated values (such as `ビル` = `Building`) can be used
throughout. The NGSI-LD specification mandates that the attributes defined in the NGSI-LD API (i.e. the core `@context`)
are used to define the attributes. Therefore elements of the request such as `id` `type` and `Property` remain
unchanged, although as we will see below this can be circumvented.

Our Japanese context provider can create a new `Building` using the request below, the `Link` header is pointing to the
Japanese JSON-LD `@context` file which supplies the full URIs for the attribute names and enumerations.

```bash
curl -L -X POST 'http://localhost:9090/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/ld+json' \
--data-raw '{
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store005",
    "type": "ビル",
    "カテゴリー": {"type": "Property", "value": ["コマーシャル"]},
    "住所": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": {
            "streetAddress": "Eisenacher Straße 98",
            "addressRegion": "Berlin",
            "addressLocality": "Marzahn",
            "postalCode": "12685"
        }
    },
    "場所": {
        "type": "GeoProperty",
        "value": {"type": "Point","coordinates": [13.5646, 52.5435]}
    },
    "名前": {"type": "Property","value": "Yuusui-en"},
    "@context":"https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/japanese-context.jsonld"
}'
```

Note that in this example the name and address have been supplied as simple strings - JSON-LD does support an `@lang`
definition to allow for internationalization, but this is an advanced topic which will not be discussed here.

### Reading an Entity using the default schema

Within the context broker the full URIs are used to refer to the attributes and enumerations. Even though it uses
different attribute short names, the Japanese JSON-LD `@context` file agrees with the standard tutorial context about
the full URIs used for a **Building** entity - effectively it is using the same data model.

Therefore it is possible to request the new **Building** (created using the Japanese data model) and have it return
using the short names specified in the standard tutorial JSON-LD `@context`, this is done by supplying the `Link` header
is pointing to the tutorial JSON-LD `@context` file.

#### 2 Request:

```bash
curl -L -X GET 'http://localhost:9090/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store005' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/ld+json' \
-H 'Link: <https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"'
```

#### Response:

The response is an ordinary **Building** entity which standard attribute names (such as `name` and `location` and it
also returns the standard enumeration for **Building** `category`.

```json
{
    "@context": "https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld",
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store005",
    "type": "Building",
    "address": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": {
            "streetAddress": "Eisenacher Straße 98",
            "addressRegion": "Berlin",
            "addressLocality": "Marzahn",
            "postalCode": "12685"
        }
    },
    "location": {
        "type": "GeoProperty",
        "value": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [13.5646, 52.5435] }
    },
    "name": { "type": "Property", "value": "Yuusui-en" },
    "category": { "type": "Property", "value": "commercial" }
}
```

This means that our Supermarket application is able to display the new building without any modification to the
underlying codebase. The data is interoperable.

Goto `http://localhost:3000/app/store/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store005` to show that the new **Building** can be displayed:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Working-with-Linked-Data/img/store5.png)

### Reading an Entity using an alternate schema

With one exception, there is no hierarchy defined within NGSI-LD `@context` files - any defined `@context` is therefore
possible to read any of the existing **Building** entities and apply the Japanese `@context`. The `@context` to used is
supplied in the `Link` header.

#### 3 Request:

```bash
curl -L -X GET 'http://localhost:9090/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store003' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/ld+json' \
-H 'Link: <https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/japanese-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"'
```

#### Response:

The response is mixed - it uses attribute names and enumerations defined in `japanese-context.jsonld` with some
exceptions. NGSI-LD **is not** JSON-LD, in that the core context is always applied after the contexts received in the
`Link` header. Since `name` and `location` are reserved attribute names, they are supplied using the default core
context.

```json
{
    "@context": "https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/japanese-context.jsonld",
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store003",

### Applying Entity Expansion/Compaction

The Within JSON-LD there is a standard mechanism for applying and altering local attribute names. The response from the
context broker will always be valid NGSI-LD. NGSI-LD is just a structured subset of JSON-LD, so further changes can be
made to use the data received as JSON.

If we need to overide the core NGSI-LD context, we can apply an additional expansion/compaction operation over the
response to retrive the data in a fully converted fashion for local use.

JSON-LD libraries already exist to do this work.

```javascript
const coreContext = require("./jsonld-context/ngsi-ld.json");
const japaneseContext = require("./jsonld-context/japanese.json");

function translateRequest(req, res) {
    request({
        url: BASE_PATH + req.path,
        method: req.method,
        headers: req.headers,
        qs: req.query,
        json: true
    })
        .then(async function(cbResponse) {
            cbResponse["@context"] = coreContext;
            const expanded = await jsonld.expand(cbResponse);
            const compacted = await jsonld.compact(expanded, japaneseContext);
            delete compacted["@context"];
            return res.send(compacted);
        })
        .catch(function(err) {
            return res.send(err);
        });
}
```

#### 4 Request:

A `/japanese` endpoint has been created which forwards a request to the context broker and then applies an
expansion/compaction operation.

```bash
curl -L -X GET 'http://localhost:3000/japanese/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store005' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Link: <https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/japanese-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"'
```

#### Response:

The response after the expansion/compaction operation is data which now uses all of the preferred attribute names - this
is **no longer** valid NGSI-LD, but would be of use if the receiving system requests data in this format.

Note that the reverse expansion/compaction operation could be used to convert this JSON back into a valid NGSI-LD
payload before sending data to the context broker.

```json
