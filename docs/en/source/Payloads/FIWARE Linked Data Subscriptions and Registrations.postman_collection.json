		"description": "This tutorial discusses the usage of subscriptions and registrations within NGSI-LD and highlights the similarities and\ndifferences between the equivalent NGSI-v2 and NGSI-LD operations. The tutorial is an analogue of the original\ncontext-provider and subscriptions tutorials but uses API calls from the **NGSI-LD** interface throughout.\n\nThe `docker-compose` files for this tutorial can be found on GitHub: \n\n![GitHub](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.LD-Subscriptions-Registrations/icon/GitHub-Mark-32px.png) [FIWARE 604. Linked Data Subscriptions and Registrations](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.LD-Subscriptions-Registrations)\n\n\n# Understanding Linked Data Subscriptions and Registrations\n\n> “Do not repeat after me words that you do not understand. Do not merely put on a mask of my ideas, for it will be an\n> illusion and you will thereby deceive yourself.”\n>\n> ― Jiddu Krishnamurti\n\nNGSI-LD Subscriptions and Registrations provide the basic mechanism to allow the components within a Smart Linked Data\nSolution to interact with each other.\n\nAs a brief reminder, within a distributed system, subscriptions inform a third party component that a change in the\ncontext data has occurred (and the component needs to take further actions), whereas registrations tell the context\nbroker that additional context information is available from another source.\n\nBoth of these operations require that the receiving component fully understands the requests it receives, and is capable\nof creating and interpreting the resultant payloads. The differences here between NGSI-v2 and NGSI-LD operations is\nsmall, but there has been a minor amendment to facilite the incorporation of linked data concepts, and therefore the\ncontract between the various components has changed to include minor updates.\n\n## Entities within a stock management system\n\nThe relationship between our Linked Data entities is defined as shown, in addition to the existing data, the `tweets`\nattribute will be supplied by a _Context Provider_. In all other respects this model remains the same as the\n[previous tutorial](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Working-with-Linked-Data/) :\n\n![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.LD-Subscriptions-Registrations/img/entities.png)\n\n## Stock Management frontend\n\nThe simple Node.js Express application has updated to use NGSI-LD in the previous\n[tutorial](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Working-with-Linked-Data/). We will use the monitor page to watch the\nstatus of recent requests, and a two store pages to buy products. Once the services are running these pages can be\naccessed from the following URLs:\n\n#### Event Monitor\n\nThe event monitor can be found at: `http://localhost:3000/app/monitor`\n\n![FIWARE Monitor](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.LD-Subscriptions-Registrations/img/monitor.png)\n\n#### Store 001\n\nStore001 can be found at: `http://localhost:3000/app/store/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001`\n\n![Store](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.LD-Subscriptions-Registrations/img/store.png)\n\n#### Store 002\n\nStore002 can be found at: `http://localhost:3000/app/store/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store002`\n\n![Store2](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.LD-Subscriptions-Registrations/img/store2.png)\n",

						"description": "NGSI-LD subscriptions can be set up using the `/ngsi-ld/v1/subscriptions/` endpoint and in a similar manner to the\nNGSI-v2 `/v2/subscriptions` endpoint. The payload body is slightly different however. Firstly the linked data `@context`\nmust be present either as an attribute or in the `Link` header. If the `@context` is placed in the body the\n`Context-Type` header must state that the payload is `application/ld+json` - i.e. Linked Data plus JSON. The supplied\n`@context` will also be used when making notifications as part of the notification request.\n\nThe `type` of the NGSI-LD subscription request is always `type=Subscription`. The structure of the subscription has\nchanged. When setting up a subscription, there is no longer a separate `subject` section to the payload, entities to\nwatch and trigger conditions are now set at the same level as the `description` of the subscription.\n\n-   `condition.attrs` has been moved up a level and renamed to `watchedAttributes`\n-   `condition.expression` has been moved up a level and renamed to `q`\n\nThe `notification` section of the body states that once the conditions of the subscription have been met, a POST request\ncontaining all affected Shelf entities will be sent to the URL `http://tutorial:3000/subscription/low-stock-store001`.\nIt is now possible to amend the notification payload by requesting `notification.format=keyValues` and remove the\n`@context` from the notification body by stating `notification.endpoint.accept=application/json`. The `@context` is not\nlost, it is merely passed as a `Link` header. In summary, all of the flags within a subscription work in the same manner\nas a GET request to the context broker itself. If no flags are set, a full NGSI-LD response including the `@context` is\nreturned by default, and the payload can be reduced and amended by adding in further restriction"

It is therefore possible to alter the state of a context-provider as a side effect. Of course, not all context\nproviders are necessarily read-write, so attempting to change the attributes of forwarded context may not be fully\nrespected.\n\nIn this case however a request to PATCH `ngsi-ld/v1/entities/<entity-id>` will be successfully forwarded as a series of\n`ngsi-ld/v1/entities/<entity-id>/attrs` requests for each regsitered attribute that is found in the registration."
